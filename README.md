# time_managment
A web app that will store data about when someone has clocked in and out of a work schedule.


Instructions/Documentation:

This web app will follow a Django structure.
The user will be able to login to an account and after loggin in be able to choose from a few different options. After logging in once, the user will stay logged in through the same device.


The program will look like a 2 week period calander, just as dad's pay period. 


- Must be able to change clock from military to standard.
- Must be able to see previous or future pay periods and edit them.
- Must have a reset button that is seperate from the update button and the reset button must promt the user to make sure they want to reset the week.
- There must be a calander button.
- Must include a break option if a user takes a break in the middle of the day.
- There have to be bounds on the time that you want to clock in and clock out.
- PTO and Holiday time needs to be accounted for.
- PTO and Holiday days need to account for the week total hour change. The weekly total hours worked needs to be 85 hours. The issue is that full PTO and Holiday days only account for 8 hours instead of 8.5 hours. This would then need to show that the hourly total needed would drop by 30 minutes per full PTO or Holiday day.
- 

UI needs to atlest show the current two week period, buttons to show the previous and next pay periods, a summary sections that shows the ammount worked for 1 week, 2 weeks, and the ammount that still needs to be worked for the 2 week pay periods. There will also be a button for the calander to navigate easier, as well as buttons to log out.

- May add in a later update that allows for total ammount made that week, as well as options to change the pay period.
